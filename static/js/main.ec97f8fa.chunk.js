Any financial projections are preliminary and subject to change; the Sponsor undertakes no obligation to update or revise these forward\u2013looking statements to reflect events or circumstances that arise after the date made or to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events. Inevitably, some assumptions will not materialize, and unanticipated events and circumstances may affect the ultimate financial results. Projections are inherently subject to substantial and numerous uncertainties and to a wide variety of significant business, economic and competitive risks, and the assumptions underlying the projections may be inaccurate in any material respect. Therefore, the actual results achieved may vary significantly from the forecasts, and the variations may be material.\nThe interests in the Issuer will not be registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the \u201cSecurities Act\u201d) in reliance upon exemptions contained in Rule 506(c) of Regulation D as promulgated under the Securities Act. In addition, the interests will not be registered under any state securities laws in reliance on exemptions from registration. Such interests are subject to restrictions on transferability and resale and may not be transferred or resold except as permitted under applicable state and federal securities laws pursuant to registration or an available exemption.\nAll investing activities risk the loss of capital. There can be no assurance that investors will not suffer significant losses. No guarantee or representation is made that investment objectives of the Issuer will be achieved. You should not subscribe to purchase interests in the Issuer unless you can readily bear the consequences of such loss.\nInterests in the Issuer are listed on the Envest Marketplace. Envest receives fees from the Sponsor or the investment vehicle partially based on the number of investor rooms created. This arrangement could create a conflict of interest between CrowdStreet and investors.\nCertain Envest employees may have an interest in, or family members or close friends of Envest employees may have an interest in, or employment or other relationship with, the Issuer or one of its affiliates. Although Envest has a thorough screening process with respect to each investment opportunity, the fact that Envest employees may have an interest in, or may have family members or close friends with an interest in, or employment or other relationship with, the Issuer or one of its affiliates could create an incentive for Envest to approve the Issuer for the Marketplace.\n'},images:{get
